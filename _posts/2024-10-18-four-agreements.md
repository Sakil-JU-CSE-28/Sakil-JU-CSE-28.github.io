- **Don't Take Anything Personally**: Realize that what others say and do is a projection of their reality, not yours.
- **Don't Make Assumptions**: Avoid misunderstandings by communicating clearly and asking questions.
- **Always Do Your Best**: Your best will vary depending on the situation, but striving for your personal best helps you avoid self-judgment and regret.
